# ComputerModeling
## Course Overview
This course reviews how to model computing resources in terms of quantity and analyzes the performance of the models. It covers basic stochastic modeling, the theory of queues and its application to real cases.

- The principal goal of this course is to make the students build their own ability to model and analyze any kind of computer-related mechanisms, which is essential for their graduate studies and professional careers.
- Students will be trained with the basic queueing theory.
- Students will have hands-on experiences with simulation tools such as SMPL, OMNet++, and NS3.
- Students will have chances of using a real-time simulator for automotive systems.
- Students will learn and analyze example algorithms including

* resource scheduling for embedded systems
* real-time tracking in ubiquitous computing environments
* wireless sensor network protocols
